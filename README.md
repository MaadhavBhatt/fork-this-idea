# Fork This Idea (Slack Bot)

A Slack bot for submitting and voting on ideas, built with Python. Submitted ideas are stored in a Firebase database, and displayed on a web page developed [here](https://github.com/yajurrsharma/fork-this-idea-website).

The Slack bot component of this project is being developed under the Thunder You-Ship-We-Ship by [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/).

I'm following the tutorial from [Slack Developer Tools](https://tools.slack.dev/bolt-python/`) in the initial stages.
